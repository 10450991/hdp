Title: Hierarchical Dirichlet Process for Categorical Count Data

Description: This R package allows users to model categorical count data with a
    hierarchical tree of Dirichlet Processes. It includes functions to
    initialise a HDP of any shape, perform Gibbs sampling of the posterior
    distribution, and analyse the output. The underlying mathematical theory is
    described by Teh et al. (Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes,
    Journal of the American Statistical Association, 2006, 101:476). This R
    package was adapted from open source MATLAB and C code written by Yee Whye
    Teh and available here
