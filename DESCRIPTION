Description: Model categorical count data with a hierarchical tree of Dirichlet
    Processes. Includes functions to initialise a HDP with a custom tree
    structure, perform Gibbs sampling of the posterior distribution,
    and analyse the output. The underlying mathematical theory is
    described by Teh et al. (Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes,
    Journal of the American Statistical Association, 2006, 101:476). This R
    package was adapted from open source MATLAB and C code written by Yee Whye
    Teh and available here
